Proprietary Software Licence – AuraaSync Codebase

1. Ownership
The entire source code, object code, scripts, documentation, and all derivative
works of the project known as AuraaSync (the “Software”) are and shall remain the
sole property of Abubackar Sidhiq (“Licensor”). No assignment or transfer of
copyright or other intellectual-property rights is made except as expressly stated
herein.

2. Grant of Licence
The Licensor grants Lumineth Private Limited (“Licensee”) a non-exclusive,
non-transferable, revocable, limited licence to use, run, and maintain the Software
solely for the purpose of operating and developing the AuraaSync business.
This licence permits internal business use and deployment on company servers
or cloud infrastructure; allows authorised employees or interns to contribute
under Licensor’s supervision; and does not permit resale, sublicensing,
public distribution, or derivative commercial products.

3. Term and Conditions
The licence continues until both (a) the Licensor is appointed Director of Lumineth
Private Limited and (b) his 25% founder equity has fully vested. Upon satisfaction of
both, all rights transfer to the Company under a separate written assignment.
If either event does not occur or the Company breaches the Agreement,
this licence terminates automatically and the Company must cease all use
or acquire full rights at Fair Market or Settlement Value.

4. Good- and Bad-Leaver Outcomes
If the Licensor becomes a Good Leaver, the Company may continue use by
purchasing rights at Fair Market or Settlement Value. If the Licensor becomes
a Bad Leaver (fraud, misconduct, breach of confidentiality, or competing activity),
the Company retains internal-use-only rights for existing deployments.

5. Confidentiality
All source code and related materials are confidential. The Licensee shall
restrict access to authorised personnel only and ensure all employees,
contractors, and interns sign confidentiality undertakings recognising
Abubackar Sidhiq as the IP owner.
